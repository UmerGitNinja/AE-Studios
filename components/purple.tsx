                Judd is a serial entrepreneur who is trying to allow humans to
                think better and be better versions of themselves. He started AE
                as a bootstrapped alternative to VC funding—hoping eventually to
                build an agency-increasing brain-computer interface operating
                system. Or, at least, to draw sufficient attention to the
                importance of designing technology focused on increasing human
                agency that, when someone inevitably designs a ubiquitous BCI
                OS, it doesn't resemble a dystopian future novel.

                That long-term quest is his ultimate goal with AE Studio, née

                services that increase human agency. He's optimistic about the

                it with him.
